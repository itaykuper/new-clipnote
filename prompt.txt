I’m building a simple web platform called Clipnote. It’s for freelance video editors and their clients to easily collaborate and exchange feedback.

There are **two types of users**:
1. Video Editor (registered user)
2. Client (guest user with no login)

Let’s structure the app like this:

---

🔐 **Video Editor Flow (Authenticated via Google or email):**

- Editor signs up or logs in (Google Auth or email/password)
- After login, they see a dashboard with a list of all their projects
- They can click "New Project"
  - Upload a video file (drag and drop)
  - Give the project a title (e.g. “Wedding Draft #1”)
  - Once uploaded, a shareable link is generated
- This link is sent to the client

---

🧾 **Client Flow (No login):**

- The client opens the link in a browser
- They see the video player and timeline
- They can click anywhere in the timeline to leave a comment (timestamp + text)
- Comments appear in a list below the video
- When done, they click "Finish Review"
  - The system notifies the video editor that comments were added

---

💬 **Editor Side After Review:**

- The editor can open the project
- See the list of comments with timestamps
- Export them as CSV or SRT
- Respond to comments (optional, for later version)

---

🧱 **Tech Stack:**

Use:
- Next.js + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Supabase for:
  - User auth (Google + email/password)
  - File storage (video uploads)
  - Database (projects, comments)
  - Real-time updates (optional)

Let’s start by building the login flow and the editor dashboard (without real upload yet). Focus on clean UI and logical structure.
 Ask me if anything is unclear.
